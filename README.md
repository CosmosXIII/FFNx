# FFNx

Next generation driver for Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII

## What
Welcome to FFNx project. If you're looking at this repository for the very first time, you will be surprised and thinking "what? another Final Fantasy driver?". The answer is: **yes!** Another driver for our beloved games :)

FFNx is an attempt to restart the development on the [code left by Aali132](https://github.com/Aali132/ff7_opengl), by actually improving the tech stack behind it as well as introducing new and unique features.

This is a WIP list of features that you can find on FFNx:
- One single driver (no more plugins to be copy-pasted left and right)
- Support for newest video and audio codecs ( WEBM, H.265, etc.)
- In-Game music OGG files playback WITH LOOP support!

For developers:
- C++ code base built on latest MSVC ( on VS2019 )
- FFMpeg 4.2.1 with H/W Accelleration support
- VGMStream using FFMpeg as backend
- Custom patched VGMStream with loop support!
- libpng 1.6.37 ( for custom textures )
- libconfuse 3.2.4 ( for the configuration management )
- glew 2.1.0 ( for OpenGL rendering )
